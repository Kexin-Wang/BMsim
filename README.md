# BMsim
Simulation for Bloch-McConnell Equation, as Jiadi Xu and Kexin Wang's answers to the exchange rate challenge.

# Exchange rate challenge
The challenge is issued by Moritz & Patrick, and the following description is from them:

The idea is to simulate the same pool system with the same preparation and compare our results. \
You can find the pool and saturation settings here:\
https://github.com/pulseq-cest/BMsim_challenge  \
and the googledocs to submit your own data here:\
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JN7VN-f1ktDrJgokb0FlUFwkH0MWYlPA_jSfnQoFOVc/ \
there you can just paste you simulation outcome.
